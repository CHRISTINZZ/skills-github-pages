A blog is a regularly updated website or web page, typically run by an individual or small group, that is written in an informal or conversational style. Blogs can cover a wide range of topics and can be used for personal expression, sharing information, or promoting a business or product. They often allow readers to leave comments and engage in discussions with the author and other readers.
